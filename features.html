<h1>Bee Purpose</h1>
<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
  We try to learn how to create compilers for domain specific languages. Bee is a DSL made for arithmetic, data algorithms, 2D graphics and geometric calculations. Bee is an imperative programming language that implement a new programming paradigm named <em>rule based programming</em>.
</div>

<h1>Bee Features</h1>

<p>Bee is a disruptive strange language that will bring Math notation into source code. Bee has uncommon keywords, operators and symbols not used in other computer languages. We have made an effort to maximize specific features listed below:</p>

<h2><a id="readable"></a>Readable</h2>
<p>Bee is designed to be learn as first programming language on our website for a Sage-Code developer. We think that you can learn Bee by reading code examples. Next design choices will make Bee code easier to read therefore easier to learn:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use short and familiar English keywords;</li>
<li>Use imperative statements based on verb keywords;</li>
<li>Use end of block keywords not curly brackets;</li>
<li>Use best operator symbols possible similar to Math;</li>
<li>Use comprehensive data literals for collections;</li>
<li>Enable comprehensive comments and code documentation;</li>
<li>Enable Greek and Cyrillic letters for identifiers;</li>
</ul>

<p>The result of these choices is demonstrate below. You can observe different comment notations enable different color. Syntax colorizer is able to identify also the keywords and highlite every statement.</p>

<h2><a id="efficient"></a>Efficient</h2>
<p>Bee is aiming for efficiency not performance. There is a difference, performance can be obtained using intensive computer resources and distributed computing. Efficiency is achieved using better algorithms and data types. Bee is designed for multi-core CPU. It enable you to create efficient applications using following techniques and features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use native data types;</li>
<li>Use mutable string types;</li>
<li>Use fixed precision arithmetic;</li>
<li>Use fixed size arrays and matrices;</li>
<li>Enable array slicing;</li>
<li>Enable lambda expressions;</li>
<li>Enable tail recursion;</li>
<li>Enable coroutines;</li>
<li>Enable concurrency;</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="safe"></a>Safe</h2>
<p>Bee is designed to be a safe language. It is difficult to make a safe language that is also efficient. To fulfill these goals we setu-up a runway architecture based on next principles and believes:</p>

<ol>
<li>There are more than one ways to resolve a problem,</li>
<li>If your problem is simple do not make it complicated,</li>
<li>If your problem is large, split it into parts,</li>
<li>Most of the time implicit behavior is good enough,</li>
<li>When implicit do not work as expected, do it explicit,</li>
<li>It is better to be proactive than reactive,</li>
<li>If something can go wrong, eventually it will,</li>
<li>Sometimes if you try a second time it will work,</li>
<li>Aim for efficiency when performance is expensive,</li>
<li>Aim for precision when perfection is impossible.</li>
</ol>


<h2><a id="modular"></a>Modular</h2>
<p>Bee applications are usually small, based on single source file. However Bee enable usage of multiple files for separation of concerns. There are 3 kind of modules in a large application:</p>

<div align="center">
  <img src="img/bee-design.svg" alt="Bee Program" width="600" class="img-fluid protect rounded" >
  <p>Bee modular design</p>
</div>
<hr>

<ol>
<li>Bee program consis of application modules and library modules</li>
<li>Main program is called <em>main module</em> and contains rule: main</li>
<li>Secondary modules can be reused in multiple Bee programs</li>
<li>Library modules are modules installed in Bee library folders</li>
<li>External modules can be installed by a package manager in Bee library folders</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Main module is the only executable module and is not reusable. Secondary modules can be loaded and public members can be executed from main() rule. Loaded modules are persistent in memory and can not be "unloaded" until the program ends. Bee has this limitation, it has to be small to be loaded in memory.</p>

<h2><a id="explicit"></a>Explicit</h2>
<p>Bee is an explicit language: We believe explicit is better than implicit. For this we try to give as much control to developers as possible. Next design choices make Bee an explicit language:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bee require declarations of data types for all elements: constants, variables, parameters and results. Unlike dynamic languages that use implicit data types that can be changed in the same scope.</li>
<li>Most languages do not have a name for result variables in functions. Bee allow developers to declare explicit names and types for every result. This is helpful when a subroutine has multiple results.</li>
<li>Precision is implicit and maximum possible in most other languages, forcing the computation of multiple decimals that are not necessary. In Bee you can define rational numbers that have fixed number of decimals therefore precision is explicit.</li>
<li>Variables and parameters are automatically initialized with zero value when there is no explicit initialization. Also, if a parameter has explicit initial value it becomes optional.</li>
<li>Bee has three assignment operators: ":", "::" and ":=". First is called "pair up". Second is called "clone", therd is called "assign". Developers can control what assignment operator actually do by using kewords: "make" to declare a new variable and "alter" to modify an existing variable.</li>
<li>In a rule, primitive type parameters are transferred <em>by value</em> while composite type parameters and objects are transferred <em>by reference</em>. Same rule apply for result variables.</li>
<li>Bee do not have pointers nor pointer arithmetic. However you can define references to primitive types using explicit boxing operator [x] that are as good as pointers.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a id="disruptive">Disruptive</h2>

<ol>
<li>Bee use Unicode operators. This is the main factor that makes Bee disruptive: { &divide; &middot; &times; &not; &and; &or; &isin; &le; &ge; &equiv; &ne; &asymp; &plusmn; &sub; &sup; &cup; &cap; &uarr; &darr; &raquo; &laquo; &oplus; ⊖ &forall; &exist;}. This can be difficult to type without a programmable keyboard.</li>
<li>Bee use one single letter for primitive types: {A B C D T F L W U N Q R S X Z} This come from mathematics. We have not used Unicode symbols: { ℂ ℍ ℕ ℙ ℚ ℝ ℤ }. We could have, but not all capital letters are available: {A B F L D S T X} there are all missing and the Bee language could look inconsistent.</li>
<li>Single letter symbols make type annotation very compact. Sometimes a list of parameters could be long with various type annotations. Avoiding long expressions is one of Bee goals, so it is logical to use short type identifiers.</li>
<li>Bee support some Greek and &Sigma; &Pi; &Delta; &Gamma; &Lambda; &Phi; &Psi; &Omega; Also we enable some lowercase Greek letters: {&lambda; &phi; &pi; &alpha; &beta; ɣ &epsilon; &delta; &mu; &omega; }</li>
<li>Bee support some Cyrillic letters: {Б Г Д Ж И Л Ф Ц Ч Ш Э Я}. We could have support all but some look too much like the Latin letters. </li>
<li>Bee support superscript numbers: {⁺⁻⁰&sup1;&sup2;&sup3;⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹}. We recognize superscript as power: x&sup2; and xⁿ. You can also use any Latin superscript characters: (ᵃ..ᶻ). Caret symbol ^ is used to deal with fraction exponent: X^(&sup1;/₂)</li>
<li>Subscript numbers are recognized as numbers in fractions like: {&sup1;/₂,⁻&sup1;/₄,&sup3;/₄...}. You can also use composite identifiers starting with a letter: (x₁, x₂, &alpha;₁, &beta;₂ &omega;₂) are some valid identifiers in Bee.</li>
<li>Bee use Unicode symbols for geometric types. These symbols are intuitive and make geometric types shorter. For example: &ang; = Angle, ⊡ = Dot, ◷ = Arc. Many other shapes are recognized.</li>
<li>Bee define the "if" statement differently than most other languages. The "if" keyword is used as a <em>conditional</em> for other statements or as ternary operator in lambda expressions.</li>
<li>Bee is using "#" for module single line comments outside of any rule or block of code. This is same symbol used in Wiki *.md pages for titles and sub-titles. It does not support indentation.</li>
<li>Bee is using "**" for single line comment inside rules and blocks. This is used in Wiki *.md files for bold. You can use "**" only at begginning of new line or after space indentation but not at the end of a line.</li>
<li>Bee use "+- ... -+" for block comment. In combination with "|" you can create boxed comments where "+" is the corner of the box. This is useful to create a module header.</li>
<li>Bee support C like comments: /* ... */ is for "expression comments" that can be used in parenthesis. Two slashes "//" represent end of line comment or statement comment. This can not be used in parenthesis or brackets and can not be used at beginning of new line. You must use ** for line comments.</li>
<li>For string pattern replication you can use star: "*" operator. For example "01" * 4 = "01010101". In other languages the same operator is numeric <em>times</em> but in Bee we are using "&middot;" for <em>times</em> like in mathematics.</li>
<li>For concatenation between two strings We have chosen: "+" and "-". A number can not be appended to a string without explicit conversion. We think that explicit is better.</li>
<li>Bee is an imperative &amp; verbose language. That is the reason we use verb statements. For example "make" will create variables, "alter" modify variables, "apply" execute a rule and so on. Code will look better due to color syntax for keywords.</li>
<li>Bee do not use any abbreviation for keywords. This enable spell checking tools, to avoid typos in source code. Also, not all developers know English. Bee offer this opportunity to learn some English while learning the language.</li>
<li>Data type is declared after the identifier, as an optional <em>hint</em>. This makes <em>type inference</em> possible. In contrast, for example in Java, usage of type keyword is mandatory before identifier. We think sometimes implicit types are good enough.</li>
<li>Bee use keyword <em>rule</em> to define a subroutine and keyword <em>apply</em> to execute a subroutine. We have considered other keyword alternatives: {"routine", "functor", "relation", "rule"}, but the <em>rule</em> is more general for all these cases.</li>
<li>Bee use prefix "*" to declare variable number of arguments. In C and JavaScript you must use 3 dots for this job "...". I think this was a poor choice. In Bee we use dots (more) to describe syntax patterns.</li>
<li>Bee use <em>sigils:</em> "$" for <em>system variables</em>. These are globals and we import all environment variables and configuration variables into the execution. Protecting these variables with a <em>sigil</em> is preventing overriding by mistake.</li>
<li>Bee use starting and ending keywords to define blocks of code, not curly brackets. This eliminate the nested bracket nightmares and improve visual aspect of the code. We can use brackets for data literals: ordinals, sets, hash tables and objects.</li>
