# Wiki Bee
Bee specification is for a multi-paradigm programming language with following goals:

* Readable
* Efficient
* Technical

## Readable
Bee strive to be readable for English speakers and mathematicians:

* Use short English keywords;
* Use end of block keywords;
* Use Unicode operators;
* Use Greek letters for symbols;
* Use imperative statements;
* Use consistent syntax rules;
* Use comprehensive data literals;
* Enable better syntax highlighter;

## Efficient
Bee is aiming for efficiency not performance. There is a difference, performance can be obtained using intensive computer resources and distributed computing. Efficiency is achieved using better algorithms and data types. Bee is designed for multi-core CPU. It enable you to create efficient applications using following techniques and features:

* Use native data types;
* Use mutable string types;
* Use fixed precision arithmetic;
* Use fixed size arrays and matrices;
* Enable array slicing;
* Enable pure functions;
* Enable lambda expressions;
* Enable tail recursion;
* Enable coroutines;
* Enable concurrency;

## Technical
Bee is designed to resolve technical problems using following principles:

1. There are more than one ways to resolve a problem,
1. If your problem is simple do not make it complicated,
1. If your problem is large, split it into parts,
1. Most of the time implicit behavior is good enough,
1. When implicit do not work as expected, do it explicit,
1. Aim for efficiency because performance is too expensive,
1. Aim for precision because perfection is impossible anyway,
1. If you fail once does not mean you will always fail,
1. If something can go wrong, eventually it will,
1. It is better to be proactive than reactive,
1. Sometimes if you try a second time it will work.
