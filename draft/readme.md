## Bee Draft

Here are some suggestions and research papers for new features.

## Procedure
1. First clone then create a new branch with your user-name in repository;
2. If you have a small feature that do not have example files just make a *.md file;
3. For examples make a sub-folder with feature-name and post example *.bee files inside;
4. Talks bout your suggestion on discord and make a pull request.

## Acceptance

If your suggestion is good, we will move it into official /syntax specification.   
For voting on next feature that is going to be promoted I use twitter.
