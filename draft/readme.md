## Bee Draft

Here are some suggestions and research papers for new features.

## Procedure
1. First clone then create a branch with your user-name in repository;
2. If you have a small feature that do not have example files just make a *.md file.   
3. For examples make a sub-folder with feature-name and post example *.bee files inside.   
4. Make a pull request

## Acceptance

If your suggestion is good, we will move it into official /syntax specification.
