# Bee Language

Bee is a general purpose computer language designed by Sage-Code Laboratory. We design this project in public with the help of community. In this repository we store language design documentation and demo code but we do not store the compiler here.

## goals

Bee is a experimental project with original syntax aiming these goals:

1. safe;
2. efficient;
3. reliable;
4. scientific;
5. disruptive;

## design 

Bee is going to be a rule based programming language.

1. strongly typed;
2. modular;
3. compiled;
4. open source;
5. feature reach;
